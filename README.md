# What is Ocuris?

Ocuris is an application that aids colorblind and hearing-impaired individuals to recognize color and sound by cue given by their mobile phone. The application would recognize sounds such as a baby's cry, fire alarm, ambulance's siren, and many more additional sounds to be added in the future for the library to grow. The second feature of the application is the color recognizing aspect. Colorblind individuals would take a picture of their interest and select the potion of the photograph that they would like to find out what color it is.
